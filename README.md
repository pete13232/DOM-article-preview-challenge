This is a solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building a projects.

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript - DOM Manipulation
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This section covers basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript. While working on this part, I tried to think in terms of "state managements" which helped me a lot when revisiting and editing the code later.

code example in below:

```js
const updateView = () => {
    updateShareBtnColor()
    if (isShareActive) {
        if (isMobile()) {
            setShareBar()
        }
        else {
            setShareToolTip()
        }
    } else {
        resetView()
    }
}
```

More examples can be found in the project above.
